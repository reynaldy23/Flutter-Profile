First Flutter project for Profile

Materials learned:
1. Stateless/ful widget is required to use flutter hot reload
2. hot reload is only usable for the code inside the stateless widget
3. widgets:
   - card
   - circle avatar
   - column (mainAxisAlignment: center to make all widgets wrapped goes center or any position wanted)
   - container
   - debugShowCheckedModeBanner: false (to hide debug banner when emulating at the device)
   - divider
   - fonts(via pubspec.yaml (fonts:) or google fonts library)
   - image
   - list tile
   - row
   - sizedbox (usually for spacing, or can be use to wrap with other widget as spacing like container, such as divider)
